//! Units of measurement is a crate that does automatic type-safe zero-cost
//! [dimensional analysis][analysis]. You can create your own systems or use the pre-built
//! [International System of Units][si] (SI) which is based on the
//! [International System of Quantities][isq] (ISQ) and includes numerous [quantities][quantity]
//! (length, mass, time, ...) with conversion factors for even more numerous
//! [measurement units][measurement] (meter, kilometer, foot, mile, ...). No more crashing your
//! [climate orbiter][orbiter]!

//!
//! ## Usage
//! `uom` requires `rustc` 1.15.0 or later. Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! uom = "0.15.0"
//! ```
//!
//! and this to your crate root:
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate uom;
//! ```
//!
//! The simple example below shows how to use quantities and units as well as how `uom` stops
//! invalid operations:
//!
#![cfg_attr(feature = "si", doc = " ```rust")]
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "si"), doc = " ```rust,ignore")]
//! extern crate uom;
//!
#![cfg_attr(feature = "f32", doc = " use uom::si::f32::*;")]
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "f32"), doc = " use uom::si::f64::*;")]
//! use uom::si::length::kilometer;
//! use uom::si::time::second;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let length = Length::new::<kilometer>(5.0);
//!     let time = Time::new::<second>(15.0);
//!     let _velocity = length / time;
//!     //let error = length + time; // error[E0308]: mismatched types
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! See examples provided with the crate for more advanced usage including how to create `Quantity`
//! type aliases for a different set of base units and how to create an entirely new system.
//!
//! ## Features
//! `uom` has five `Cargo` features: `data`, `f32`, `f64`, `si`, and `std`. The features are
//! described below and are enabled by default. Features can be cherry-picked by using the
//! `--no-default-features` and `--features "..."` flags when compiling `uom` or specifying features
//! in Cargo.toml:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! uom = { version = "0.15.0", default-features = false, features = ["data", "f32", "f64", "si", "std"] }
//! ```
//!
//!  * `data` -- Feature to include the pre-build data system that includes a single quantity,
//!    information (bytes).
//!  * `f32`, `f64` -- Features to enable underlying storage types. At least one of these features
//!    must be enabled.
//!  * `si` -- Feature to include the pre-built [International System of Units][si] (SI).
//!  * `std` -- Feature to compile with standard library support. Disabling this feature compiles
//!    `uom` with `no_std`. Note that some functions such as `sqrt` require `std` to be enabled.
//!
//! [si]: http://jcgm.bipm.org/vim/en/1.16.html
//!
//! ## Design
//! Rather than working with [measurement units](http://jcgm.bipm.org/vim/en/1.9.html) (meter,
//! kilometer, foot, mile, ...) `uom` works with [quantities](http://jcgm.bipm.org/vim/en/1.1.html)
//! (length, mass, time, ...). This simplifies usage because units are only involved at interface
//! boundaries: the rest of your code only needs to be concerned about the quantities involved. This
//! also makes operations on quantities (+, -, \*, /, ...) have zero runtime cost<sup>1</sup> over
//! using the raw storage type (e.g. `f32`).
//!
//! `uom` normalizes values to the [base unit](http://jcgm.bipm.org/vim/en/1.10.html) for the
//! quantity. Alternative base units can be used by executing the macro defined for the system of
//! quantities (`ISQ!` for the SI). `uom` supports both `f32` and `f64` as the underlying storage
//! type.
